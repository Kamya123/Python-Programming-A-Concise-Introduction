00:00:12.046 --> 00:00:14.780
Let's start learning the syntax of Python.

2
00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.670
First of all,
you have arithmetic operations, and

3
00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.200
I'll quickly go through a sample of those.

4
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.686
I'll show you how they work.

5
00:00:25.686 --> 00:00:31.090
13 + 3 is 16, 13- 3 gives you 10.

6
00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:36.873
13 x 3 is 39.

7
00:00:36.873 --> 00:00:41.080
2 raised to the 3rd power is 8.

8
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.643
13 divided by 3 is 4.

9
00:00:45.643 --> 00:00:51.253
13 divided by 3 in this way, this is
an integer line, and divide it to and

10
00:00:51.253 --> 00:00:55.900
find the integer and
throw away the fraction, it's just 4.

11
00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.877
And 13% 3 Is the remainder

12
00:01:00.877 --> 00:01:05.263
upon dividing 13 by 3.
