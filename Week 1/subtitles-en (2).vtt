00:00:10.113 --> 00:00:13.180
Now let's look at a simple
function in Python.

2
00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.036
The kernel that we have,
percent, pound percent sent, and

3
00:00:17.036 --> 00:00:21.710
pound percent sent, and
they mark out a cell.

4
00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.840
These lines show you
the boundaries of the cell.

5
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.550
Here we have a function
defined within a cell, and

6
00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.640
we can execute that by typing Ctrl, Enter.

7
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.795
On a Macintosh it would be command return.

8
00:00:37.985 --> 00:00:41.345
Now this function can be run by

9
00:00:44.565 --> 00:00:47.915
typing in the console
the name of the function.

10
00:00:47.915 --> 00:00:49.005
Hello, world!

11
00:00:49.005 --> 00:00:51.795
A couple of things to note about this.

12
00:00:51.795 --> 00:00:55.300
One is it's got a single statement.

13
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.690
Print hello world.

14
00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:58.330
And it does that.

15
00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:03.730
And this statement is indented four
spaces, one, two, three, four.

16
00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:09.330
We always indent four spaces we don't
use tabs that can sometimes cause

17
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.460
confusion on the part of python.

18
00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.910
I've also got a string here
enclosed in triple quotes.

19
00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:23.470
This string can be used to
document the program, and

20
00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:29.776
if you notice up here in [INAUDIBLE]
inspector,

21
00:01:29.776 --> 00:01:36.470
you can get the definitions
of various functions and

22
00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.620
we can get the definition of our
function by clicking on hello.

23
00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.800
Yeah, I'm here type in control I.

24
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:51.210
Then our function shows up here in this
triple queried string is a documentation

25
00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.330
so that you can put instructions on how to
run your program for example in that or

26
00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.850
your function.

27
00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.670
Now let's write another function.

28
00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.080
Here's the area of a circle
of a given radius.

29
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.380
Again we've got pound percent
cent to mark out the cell.

30
00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.220
We can execute this [INAUDIBLE]
anywhere in the cell and

31
00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.267
type in control enter or
command return on a Macintosh.

32
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.130
That puts, that loads it into
the console window over here.

33
00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:34.310
And now we can run it by typing, Area
of a circle, the name of the function.

34
00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.747
And I'll give it a value of five for
the radius.

35
00:02:37.747 --> 00:02:44.080
It prints out the area of
a circle of radius 5 is 78.5.

36
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.570
Now let's look at does that first of all,

37
00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.278
we have the formula for
the area of a circle.

38
00:02:51.278 --> 00:02:56.883
Area is equal to pi,
3.14 times the radius, squared.

39
00:02:56.883 --> 00:03:00.325
Just a simple formula for
the area of a circle.

40
00:03:00.325 --> 00:03:05.960
Now, we print the phrase,
the area of a circle of radius,

41
00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:13.500
all about the radius is all
about the area that we computed.

42
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.290
Now you try writing a function,
here is an exercise to do.

43
00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:24.210
Write a function def area triangle
BH where B is the base and H

44
00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:29.410
is the height of the triangle, to compute
the area of a triangle the formula is area

45
00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.650
equals one half base times the height,
output should look like the following.

46
00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.586
The area of a triangle of base 3 and
height 5 is 7 and a half.

47
00:03:38.586 --> 00:03:41.935
You can test your function by
executing the following code.

48
00:03:41.935 --> 00:03:46.227
Here's a triangle of base 3 and height 5,

49
00:03:46.227 --> 00:03:50.060
here's one of base 2 and height 20.

50
00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:51.850
Here is my run of this.

51
00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:57.071
The area of a triangle of base 3 and
height 5 is 7.5.

52
00:03:57.071 --> 00:04:00.940
The area of a triangle of base 2 and
height 20 is 20.

53
00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.043
Now you try it, when you get through,
press continue and

54
00:04:05.043 --> 00:04:07.106
I'll show you my solution.

55
00:04:12.588 --> 00:04:14.753
Okay, here is my solution.

56
00:04:19.323 --> 00:04:21.744
Definition area of triangle,

57
00:04:21.744 --> 00:04:27.620
bh is area equal one-half base times
the height, just that same formula.

58
00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:33.738
Print the area of a triangle of base,
b, and height h, is area.
