00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:18.058
Now let's write a function that
takes input from the keyboard and

2
00:00:18.058 --> 00:00:20.156
also combines strings.

3
00:00:20.156 --> 00:00:20.882
Here's an example.

4
00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:30.818
This function is supposed to get
my name and then write it out.

5
00:00:30.818 --> 00:00:32.240
All right, so I write name.

6
00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.320
My name is Bill, that was first name.

7
00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:45.130
My last names Boyd and
it will write out your name is Bill Boyd.

8
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.970
So, let's look and see how that worked.

9
00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.850
First of all you know we still
have the documentation and

10
00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.140
I can see that at the top.

11
00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.010
I type in Ctrl+I, okay.

12
00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.120
I'm using an input statement
to get from the keyboard.

13
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.495
Now I have to have a prompt, so

14
00:01:05.495 --> 00:01:09.580
that the person will know
what I want to be entered.

15
00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.642
So, the input statement
has a prompt as a string,

16
00:01:13.642 --> 00:01:16.946
enter your first name, you see it here.

17
00:01:16.946 --> 00:01:22.325
And then I typed in Bill and
it stored that in this

18
00:01:22.325 --> 00:01:27.320
variable called fname, F for first name.

19
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.410
And then I ask for
another input, and I ask for

20
00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:37.840
last name this time is started into
a variable called lname for last name.

21
00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.793
Now I make the full name
by taking the first name

22
00:01:42.793 --> 00:01:46.610
concatenate or adding the string.

23
00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:52.362
A little blank to separate
the first name from the last name.

24
00:01:52.362 --> 00:01:56.900
And then I'll add on the last name.

25
00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.160
So, I've got the full name
put together here and

26
00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.430
then I'm going to print it together,
print it out.

27
00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.540
Print "your name is" and
we'll print the full name.

28
00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.450
So, what's new here is with
the input statement and

29
00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.540
with concatenation, or adding of strings.

30
00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:16.331
Now, you try it.

31
00:02:16.331 --> 00:02:23.525
I want you to take the same function and
add a couple of features to it.

32
00:02:23.525 --> 00:02:28.412
In addition to getting your name, putting
it together into a string and printing it.

33
00:02:28.412 --> 00:02:34.136
I want you to get the city
that you live in and

34
00:02:34.136 --> 00:02:39.075
the state or nation that you live in.

35
00:02:39.075 --> 00:02:45.300
And write that out in the fashion
that I'm showing you here.

36
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.090
Here is my run.

37
00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.000
Enter your first name, Bill.

38
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.710
Enter your last name, Boyd.

39
00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.100
Enter the city you live in, Middletown.

40
00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.590
Enter the state you live in,
my case Connecticut, okay?

41
00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.400
Your name is Bill Boyd.

42
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.090
This is from the previous program example.

43
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:11.180
And now, you live in Middletown, and I've
put that Middletown down, Connecticut.

44
00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.305
And I made a longer string that has
Middletown, Connecticut in it, but

45
00:03:15.305 --> 00:03:17.179
they're separated by a comma.

46
00:03:19.785 --> 00:03:25.608
So, when you go and try and write this
your self and then when you get through,

47
00:03:25.608 --> 00:03:30.282
press the continuation button and
I'll show you my example.

48
00:03:36.374 --> 00:03:37.682
Okay, here is my solution.

49
00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:46.230
I have documentation,

50
00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.333
if you like to see that.

51
00:03:54.217 --> 00:03:57.263
Input first and last name,
this documentation is useful and

52
00:03:57.263 --> 00:04:00.460
that gives you instructions
to some work to do.

53
00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:02.320
Input first and last name.

54
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.640
Combine to one string and print.

55
00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.498
Also input the city and state and print.

56
00:04:09.498 --> 00:04:15.548
Now, this is exactly what we
had before that's not new but

57
00:04:15.548 --> 00:04:20.504
here's an input statement
that gets the city.

58
00:04:20.504 --> 00:04:24.958
Here's an input statement
that gets the state and

59
00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:29.420
then I combine the city and
state into one string.

60
00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:34.970
And that string has got comma space in the
middle of it to separate city from state.

61
00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.380
Now I can print your name is and

62
00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:45.262
print you live in, city, state.

63
00:04:45.262 --> 00:04:49.909
And you don't want to put
this input statement after

64
00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:52.662
you've printed out the name.

65
00:04:52.662 --> 00:04:56.616
Because then over here it wouldn't
have collected all the data and

66
00:04:56.616 --> 00:04:58.970
then written out the result.

67
00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:03.154
It would have connected part of the data
or written out part of the result,

68
00:05:03.154 --> 00:05:06.810
collected some more data and
written out the rest of the result.

69
00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:07.790
That just wouldn't be coot.
