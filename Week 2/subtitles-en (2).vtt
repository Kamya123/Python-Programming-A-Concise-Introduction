00:00:11.578 --> 00:00:16.922
Now let's do another example of a function
using a loop to step through a list.

2
00:00:29.067 --> 00:00:32.643
Notice that we have a list called
newEngland that has the states

3
00:00:32.643 --> 00:00:36.096
of newEngland, Maine,
New Hampshire, Vermont and so on.

4
00:00:36.096 --> 00:00:42.051
And we have a function for_state, and
it will step through this last slis,

5
00:00:42.051 --> 00:00:46.440
and for each state in slis,
it'll print the state.

6
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.586
Now let's see this run.

7
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.156
Note that instead of using slis,
we're giving it

8
00:00:59.156 --> 00:01:04.760
the actual list, newEngland,
and there they are.

9
00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:05.590
In this case,

10
00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.816
we stepped through the items on the list
one at a time, and printed them.

11
00:01:11.921 --> 00:01:15.635
Now, what you need to write is a simple
function that will print a list.

12
00:01:23.173 --> 00:01:25.398
Here's some lists to test it out on.

13
00:01:33.148 --> 00:01:35.115
Here's my run of my solution,

14
00:01:35.115 --> 00:01:39.898
press return when you have finished
your solution and I will show you mine.

15
00:01:49.167 --> 00:01:52.817
Here is the function print list,
for each item in the list,

16
00:01:52.817 --> 00:01:54.570
just simply print the item.

17
00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.480
This will step through
the list one item at a time,

18
00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.120
and then that will print the item.

19
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.374
That's all there is to it,
notice that it works on any kind of list.
