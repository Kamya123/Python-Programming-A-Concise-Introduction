00:00:10.852 --> 00:00:14.882
Now let's talk about Python data types.

2
00:00:14.882 --> 00:00:18.150
Here are a number of examples.

3
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.700
I'll just execute that so
you can see them.

4
00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:27.632
First of all, x up there is an integer,
y is called a float,

5
00:00:27.632 --> 00:00:32.479
that's a real number,
it's got a fractional part.

6
00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:37.335
And z is a string, a string of characters.

7
00:00:37.335 --> 00:00:41.636
z1 is also a string,
it's a string of digits.

8
00:00:41.636 --> 00:00:45.642
z2 is a string of digits as well.

9
00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:52.920
Here is a list, it's a list of vowels.

10
00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:55.692
Here, a list of numbers.

11
00:00:55.692 --> 00:01:02.247
Actually, it's a list of strings
each of which is a number string.

12
00:01:04.779 --> 00:01:11.660
Here is another list, and
this is a list of strings.

13
00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.290
Twas brillig and slithy toves.

14
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.401
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe,
so it has two strings in it.

15
00:01:21.505 --> 00:01:27.550
Here is a boolean that's true,
here's a boolean that's false.

16
00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.140
Now generally speaking, you've gotta
be a little bit careful about these.

17
00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:41.190
For example, if you're trying to add z1+2,
it can't convert it.

18
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.340
That's because z1 is a string.

19
00:01:46.632 --> 00:01:51.688
I can actually do that if I change z1 to

20
00:01:51.688 --> 00:01:56.750
an integer, then I can do it that way.

21
00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.214
Also, if you take,
let's write z1 is that, z2 is that.

22
00:02:03.214 --> 00:02:10.520
Now z1 + z2, what's going to happen there?

23
00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.550
Well, those are not integers and

24
00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.290
they're not floating point numbers,
so they won't add as numbers.

25
00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:18.524
They won't give me 70.

26
00:02:19.885 --> 00:02:26.794
They'll give me a string,
which consists of z1 followed by z2.

27
00:02:26.794 --> 00:02:31.371
Now I want to add those two as

28
00:02:31.371 --> 00:02:36.554
numbers, I can do it this way.

29
00:02:41.654 --> 00:02:44.600
Often you can convert
from one type to another.

30
00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:52.600
So if I want to take y,
convert it to a string,

31
00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.380
I just apply the string function.

32
00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.220
I can do the same thing with x, but

33
00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:08.038
I can't do that with z,
because that's a walrus.

34
00:03:08.038 --> 00:03:13.301
I can't convert the walrus and

35
00:03:13.301 --> 00:03:17.962
the carpenter to a string.
