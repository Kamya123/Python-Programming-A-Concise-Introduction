00:00:10.604 --> 00:00:15.180
Now let's look at a function where we need
to convert from one data type to another.

2
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.410
This function will multiply two numbers.

3
00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:24.064
Let's watch it work.

4
00:00:34.778 --> 00:00:40.690
going to enter a number,
7, and another number, 3.

5
00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.730
And we get the product of 21.

6
00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.290
Let's see how that's done.

7
00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.550
First we have an input
statement to get one number in,

8
00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:52.940
but it comes in as a string.

9
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.260
We then have another input statement
to enter the other number, and

10
00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.020
it also will come in as a string.

11
00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.240
Then we take the string, numstr1 and
convert it to a float, num1.

12
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.250
Then we do the same thing with num2,
convert it to a float.

13
00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.110
And then we can take the product
num1 * num2, and print that out.

14
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:27.540
Now let me emphasize that if we had tried
to multiply these two, it wouldn't work.

15
00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.630
Here is an example of that.

16
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.130
Let me comment this line out.

17
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.140
I'm going to go up here to edit and
put comment.

18
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.423
And then I'm going to
un-comment this line,

19
00:01:40.423 --> 00:01:44.020
go back to edit, un-comment that.

20
00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:51.542
Now let's run this again and
see what goes wrong.

21
00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:58.364
That's up arrow, go back to the multiply.

22
00:01:58.364 --> 00:02:03.293
Now we're going to enter seven again,

23
00:02:03.293 --> 00:02:06.170
times three, boom.

24
00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.310
We get a type error.

25
00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:13.919
Can't multiply sequence by
non integers of type strain.

26
00:02:19.144 --> 00:02:21.011
Now let me restore these.
