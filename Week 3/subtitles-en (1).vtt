00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.218
Before we go on, I want to talk about
a few operating system commands and

2
00:00:17.218 --> 00:00:21.010
how you can execute those
from within IPython console.

3
00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:29.596
First of all,
I'm going to get a fresh IPython console.

4
00:00:29.596 --> 00:00:34.623
Now if you want to see
what directory you're in,

5
00:00:34.623 --> 00:00:41.546
on a Linux machine or a Mac,
you can type PWD, and I'll show you.

6
00:00:41.546 --> 00:00:44.282
That won't work on a PC, but

7
00:00:44.282 --> 00:00:49.870
it will work in an IPython console
window on a PC, or on a Mac.

8
00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.337
If you want to see what files are there,
you can type LS on a Mac, or

9
00:00:53.337 --> 00:00:54.950
a Linux machine to see them.

10
00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.700
That won't work on a PC, but
it will work in an IPython console window.

11
00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.612
On a PC if you want to
see what your working

12
00:01:09.612 --> 00:01:13.734
directory is you have to type "cd

13
00:01:14.775 --> 00:01:19.025
Now if you type an exclamation
point in front of a command,

14
00:01:19.025 --> 00:01:25.360
IPython will pass that on down to the
underlying operating system so this works.

15
00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.370
It won't work within the IPython window.

16
00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.020
But it will work if I pass it
down to the PC operating system.

17
00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:40.850
And in a PC if you want to see what
files are there you type DIR in iPython

18
00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.120
console when I have to type an exclamation
point in front of pass it all down.

19
00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.610
Anyway, there are a couple
of really basic things

20
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.040
that you should know about iPython and
about the operating systems.

21
00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.720
Now, we want to move on to reading and
writing files.

22
00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.740
Now, before starting that,
I want to get a fresh console window.

23
00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.560
I click that on a way,
open an act IPython console here.

24
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.470
Now, let's talk about reading and
writing text files.

25
00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.070
Here's an example.

26
00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.503
I have a function, I have a textile
up here, humptydumpty.text and

27
00:02:25.503 --> 00:02:26.480
I'm going to print it.

28
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.380
There it is,
now let's see how it did that.

29
00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.703
First of all,
we passed it the file name, and

30
00:02:41.703 --> 00:02:47.400
we use the file name to open a file and
we assign the handle to that file infile.

31
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.060
We'll refer to this infile
throughout the rest of the program,

32
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.120
where the line an infile, we'll print
that line and then we'll close the file.

33
00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:02.000
The reason we have and equal blank is
that the text files have a new line at

34
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.060
the end of every line, print has
a new line at the end of every line.

35
00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.040
If we had two new lines it would be double
space so we get rid of the one with print.

36
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.140
Now let's do another example.

37
00:03:18.412 --> 00:03:22.500
We will copy one file to another so you
can see how reading and writing differ.

38
00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.740
Right, I'm going to copy

39
00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:42.903
humptydumpty.txt to xhumpty.txt.

40
00:03:44.702 --> 00:03:48.754
Okay, and you didn't see anything happened
here because all that had happened

41
00:03:48.754 --> 00:03:49.555
right up here.

42
00:03:49.555 --> 00:03:52.822
There is humpty, there he is,
it's been copied.

43
00:03:54.222 --> 00:03:55.372
Now lets see how we did that.

44
00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.201
We had two files, an in-file name and
an out-file name.

45
00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.490
Here they are.

46
00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:05.050
Okay.

47
00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:09.137
We open the in-file name and
we all sign the handle in-file,

48
00:04:09.137 --> 00:04:14.250
we'll open the out-file name and
we'll assign a handle out file.

49
00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.990
This time we are going to write to it so
we'll use this option W.

50
00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:24.552
For every line in that in file,
we are going to write that line,

51
00:04:24.552 --> 00:04:29.260
and use an out file dot write,
that's a method of out file.

52
00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.869
Then we are going to close both files.

53
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.920
It's just simple as that.

54
00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:41.571
Now I want you to write
a function that we'll

55
00:04:41.571 --> 00:04:47.952
take data from the screen and
write it into a file.

56
00:04:47.952 --> 00:04:49.329
Let me show you mine.

57
00:04:53.331 --> 00:04:59.253
I've given you a starter
file,write_to_file(filename,

58
00:04:59.253 --> 00:05:01.895
myname, myage, major).

59
00:05:01.895 --> 00:05:06.825
And this one almost would
write the name out.

60
00:05:06.825 --> 00:05:08.255
So we got to open the file first.

61
00:05:08.255 --> 00:05:11.735
You're going to have to close
the file eventually, okay.

62
00:05:12.815 --> 00:05:16.255
These lines tell you what
you need to do where.

63
00:05:16.255 --> 00:05:21.065
This is mine, this is where I ran it,
and this is where I displayed it.

64
00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:26.410
My name is George, my age is 21,
I major in physics.

65
00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:28.420
You should do something like that.

66
00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:37.763
Here's my solution.

67
00:05:37.763 --> 00:05:42.548
I'll open that file name for write, and

68
00:05:42.548 --> 00:05:46.925
I'll sign out-file as the handle.

69
00:05:47.945 --> 00:05:51.719
Out-file.write, my name is,
then I'll stick in my name and

70
00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:53.155
then a character turn.

71
00:05:55.495 --> 00:05:57.875
Out-file.write my name is.

72
00:05:57.875 --> 00:06:02.260
I'm going to convert my age,
which is a number to a string so

73
00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:08.080
that I can take this string and tack on
this string and then tack on this string.

74
00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:16.237
Then I'm going to pick out found.right and
but

75
00:06:16.237 --> 00:06:20.120
my major I am majoring in but the major.

76
00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:25.100
So and the only thing that you
may have overlooked as you're

77
00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:30.090
sticking in that that conversion and
number trust string.

78
00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:32.290
And then of course you close the file.
