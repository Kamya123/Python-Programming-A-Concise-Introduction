00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.355
This video shows how to run Python programs on Windows 10 PC without using Spyder.

2
00:00:18.355 --> 00:00:21.415
The remaining videos use Spyder to do the same thing,

3
00:00:21.415 --> 00:00:23.035
using a feature Spyder,

4
00:00:23.035 --> 00:00:26.380
which may be phased out by the time you get to this point.

5
00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.230
That feature, I'll discuss at the end of this video.

6
00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.250
This is the program that we're going to run, print("Hello World!"),

7
00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.415
just a simple program,

8
00:00:37.415 --> 00:00:41.155
doesn't have to be complicated to illustrate running programs.

9
00:00:41.155 --> 00:00:43.745
Here it is in my directory.

10
00:00:43.745 --> 00:00:46.220
Now, to open a command prompt,

11
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.000
I'm going to get in here to Cortana, search field,

12
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.340
then I'll type CMD,

13
00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.295
then I'll choose command prompt,

14
00:00:55.295 --> 00:00:57.384
and there it opens.

15
00:00:57.384 --> 00:00:59.395
Then I will type, cd space documents/pythoncoursera/lesson3.

16
00:00:59.395 --> 00:01:15.190
That's where that pattern is on my machine.

17
00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.445
Yours may be at a different place.

18
00:01:17.445 --> 00:01:23.395
Now type, python hello, and run it.

19
00:01:23.395 --> 00:01:25.890
That's all there's to.

20
00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.450
Let me give you a couple of other things that you might need, and might not know.

21
00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.380
If you need to know whether the program is saying you can type dir.

22
00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.560
Now, in this case,

23
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.605
there's so many files there, I can't find it.

24
00:01:38.605 --> 00:01:41.635
So, I type dir and hello,

25
00:01:41.635 --> 00:01:46.425
and I use this wildcard asterisk

26
00:01:46.425 --> 00:01:51.855
to show me everything that begins with "hello", and ends in.py.

27
00:01:51.855 --> 00:01:54.240
And there are two things out there.

28
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.620
So, I can see that the file is there.

29
00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.830
Also in getting there,

30
00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.993
you may need to move upper directory.

31
00:02:02.993 --> 00:02:07.290
Say, if we are from lesson three to the directory above it,

32
00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:13.125
it may need to move down a directory,

33
00:02:13.125 --> 00:02:16.850
and you can do that.

34
00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:23.190
Now, let me show you another way to do this.

35
00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.425
First, I'm going to shrink this to kind of get it over either way,

36
00:02:28.425 --> 00:02:31.690
then I'm opening up this directory.

37
00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.995
This is Windows Explorer,

38
00:02:33.995 --> 00:02:35.280
and it shows "hello,

39
00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.010
right there!", in this directory.

40
00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.140
Now, let's go run hello again.

41
00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.995
Click the end of the Cortana search field,

42
00:02:46.995 --> 00:02:51.487
and type CMD, run the command prompt.

43
00:02:51.487 --> 00:02:55.120
And I'm going to move this parallel to that,

44
00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.015
so that they're both visible easily.

45
00:02:58.015 --> 00:03:02.335
Up here, notice that this tells you where I am,

46
00:03:02.335 --> 00:03:05.700
but it's not in a path for me.

47
00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.640
But if I click here in the white,

48
00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.745
it changes and highlights,

49
00:03:09.745 --> 00:03:12.770
and I can type, Control+C and copy it.

50
00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:14.550
Then I go over here, and type cd space,

51
00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:18.545
Control+V to paste it there.

52
00:03:18.545 --> 00:03:22.420
That keeps you from having to do all of this typing

53
00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.425
and avoid errors and typos or somethings like that.

54
00:03:27.425 --> 00:03:30.195
So, now we're at the right directory.

55
00:03:30.195 --> 00:03:36.530
We can type python hello.py, and it runs again.

56
00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.059
So, you just click here, paste here.

57
00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:46.820
Now, let's look at a third way of doing this.

58
00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.375
Back here in Spyder,

59
00:03:49.375 --> 00:03:53.100
we've got the directory up there, "Hello" is here.

60
00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.015
I'm going to use that to get there.

61
00:03:56.015 --> 00:04:00.515
Click down here, CMD,

62
00:04:00.515 --> 00:04:05.895
bring this up, put it up here parallel.

63
00:04:05.895 --> 00:04:09.230
Now, I'm going to click over here, and highlight that,

64
00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.775
press Control+C to copy it over the Window,

65
00:04:13.775 --> 00:04:19.370
cd space, Control+V, put on the python hello.py,

66
00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.805
and then run it.

67
00:04:22.805 --> 00:04:28.430
Now, earlier in the course,

68
00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.160
we wrote our programs here,

69
00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:37.025
and then we ran them in the IPython console down here.

70
00:04:37.025 --> 00:04:40.270
What we're going to do when we have whole words,

71
00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:41.900
we're going to write them here,

72
00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.415
and run them over here.

73
00:04:43.415 --> 00:04:45.880
So, we've got a different pane that's outside of

74
00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.180
Spyder running the program, but it works no different.

75
00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.820
Let me type the change to this program.

76
00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:59.186
Print("Goodbye"),

77
00:04:59.186 --> 00:05:04.502
save that change over here,

78
00:05:04.502 --> 00:05:06.510
paste that there, bring it in,

79
00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:10.050
run it, do you see a change?

80
00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:17.850
Now, let's look ahead at what's going to be coming up.

81
00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:20.505
I'm going to be writing programs like this.

82
00:05:20.505 --> 00:05:24.160
In my case, I have a copy of Spyder,

83
00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.690
then in the tools menu,

84
00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.635
there is an open command prompt, watch down here.

85
00:05:28.635 --> 00:05:32.029
When I click on open command prompt,

86
00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:37.015
I got a command prompt just like this one. Colors are reversed.

87
00:05:37.015 --> 00:05:44.423
It's just like this one. I can type python hello.py,

88
00:05:44.423 --> 00:05:46.920
and run this program.
