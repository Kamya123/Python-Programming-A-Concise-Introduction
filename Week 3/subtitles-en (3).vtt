00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.810
So far we've been writing and
running functions.

2
00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:18.600
Now we want to start writing and
running whole programs.

3
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.320
And on a Macintosh and on Linux machines,
Python 2 comes installed.

4
00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.794
Your machine may attempt to
run our programs in Python 2,

5
00:00:28.794 --> 00:00:32.915
which doesn't work, or
it may run them in Python 3.

6
00:00:32.915 --> 00:00:36.430
We're going to determine that right now.

7
00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:44.270
Go up to spotlight, type in terminal,
press enter, run it.

8
00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.180
Type Python, press return.

9
00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.847
On my machine it returns
Python 3 point something, so

10
00:00:53.847 --> 00:00:59.007
mine is going to run Python 3
automatically, yours may too.

11
00:00:59.007 --> 00:01:03.066
If it does, skip to the next video, you
don't need to create an environment for

12
00:01:03.066 --> 00:01:03.680
Python 3.

13
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.700
If yours displays Python 2 point
something, then you need to

14
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.520
create an environment, and I'm going to
show you how to do that very quick.

15
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.540
Okay, let me exit from Python.

16
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.688
First, let me show you how to determine
what version of Python you're using.

17
00:01:23.218 --> 00:01:27.926
Okay, if I bring Spyder up,
mine says 3.6.2,

18
00:01:27.926 --> 00:01:32.280
you should do that and
write down the version.

19
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.903
If you installed an environment for
that version,

20
00:01:34.903 --> 00:01:38.014
I think it will go a little bit
faster than if you install it for

21
00:01:38.014 --> 00:01:41.187
a different version,
although it'll work perfectly fine.

22
00:01:41.187 --> 00:01:46.030
Once you've done that, Go back to this.

23
00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.713
Now I will show you how to determine if
you have an environments already on your

24
00:01:50.713 --> 00:01:51.370
machine.

25
00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.913
You use conda info --envs.

26
00:01:59.581 --> 00:02:03.000
And you can see that I have
four environments out there.

27
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.550
Yours will probably have just one,
and that'll be root.

28
00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.950
Now we're going to create
other environments.

29
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:18.680
And this is the command that you use
to do that, conda create -n for name.

30
00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.790
And then I'm going to create
one called python362,

31
00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:26.850
because I'm going to create
an environment for running Python 3.6.2,

32
00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:32.470
which is a version that I
had when I looked at Spyder.

33
00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.743
You've written it down, you can- Do

34
00:02:36.743 --> 00:02:42.210
whatever version your machine has.

35
00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:49.653
Now this name is can be anything,
you can name it whatever you want.

36
00:02:49.653 --> 00:02:54.743
And you put for Python version,
whatever version you got, and Spyder.

37
00:02:57.021 --> 00:03:01.095
Once you've entered that, press return and

38
00:03:01.095 --> 00:03:06.786
it'll start fetching what it
needs to from the web to install.

39
00:03:08.651 --> 00:03:12.228
When it gets through, it'll ask you
whether you want to proceed and

40
00:03:12.228 --> 00:03:12.930
you say yes.

41
00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:20.500
And now it's installing that additional
software and creating an environment.

42
00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.330
This may take a few minutes.

43
00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.636
Yours may display additional
lines as it does,

44
00:03:26.636 --> 00:03:29.372
depending on how much work it has to do.

45
00:03:33.035 --> 00:03:35.980
Now it tells you to
activate that environment.

46
00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.160
You type source activate and
then the name for your environment.

47
00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:48.770
So I'm going to activate mine,
source activate- python362.

48
00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:53.453
The name for
yours will likely be different from mine.

49
00:03:56.851 --> 00:03:59.942
Now I can test that in a couple of ways.

50
00:03:59.942 --> 00:04:05.987
One, is I can run Python, and it should
display Python 3 something really,

51
00:04:05.987 --> 00:04:12.500
it's not critical on what it does just as
long as it displays the Python 3 version.

52
00:04:14.391 --> 00:04:19.621
Also, I can say conda info --envs,

53
00:04:19.621 --> 00:04:25.770
and I can see the environments out there.

54
00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.860
This asterisk shows
which one is activated.

55
00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.936
Since we use source activate
to activate Python362,

56
00:04:33.936 --> 00:04:37.610
it's the one that's activated.

57
00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:42.080
Now, let's repeat the process
that you'll need to use

58
00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.050
in order to activate this environment.

59
00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:51.036
First of all, I'm going to close terminal,
and we just going to quit it altogether.

60
00:04:51.036 --> 00:04:52.540
I'm going to we go up here,

61
00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:57.420
I'm going to type in terminal,
Press enter, and I bring it up.

62
00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.878
Now, I'm going to type source activate

63
00:05:03.878 --> 00:05:09.100
python362, and now I'm ready to go.

64
00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:15.340
So now go onto the next video and
we'll show you how to run Python programs.

65
00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.530
Remember, you need to bring up
a terminal and type source activate and

66
00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:24.960
the name of your Python 3 environment,
and then you're ready to go.
