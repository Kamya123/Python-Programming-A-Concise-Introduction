00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.279
The purpose of this video is to show
you how to run Python programs.

2
00:00:15.313 --> 00:00:18.330
Here's a very simple Python program.

3
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.927
In fact, it is so simple we can run it
in our IPython console like we used to.

4
00:00:23.927 --> 00:00:27.788
As you can see it prints hello,
World and that's all.

5
00:00:27.788 --> 00:00:31.164
Most Python programs you
cannot run this way.

6
00:00:31.164 --> 00:00:34.449
You cannot run them in IPython console.

7
00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:36.636
So let me show you how to do that.

8
00:00:39.453 --> 00:00:43.476
First of all,
I'm going to shrink Spyder to half window.

9
00:00:43.476 --> 00:00:48.405
I'm going to go to Spotlight, and
I'm going to type in terminal.

10
00:00:51.917 --> 00:00:55.603
And that brings up a terminal window.

11
00:00:55.603 --> 00:01:02.564
The next thing that I have to do is to
go to the current working directory.

12
00:01:02.564 --> 00:01:06.661
I highlight it, type Cmd+C.

13
00:01:11.317 --> 00:01:13.412
Then I go back over here to the terminal.

14
00:01:13.412 --> 00:01:19.423
And I type cd space Cmd+V,
to paste it into the command.

15
00:01:19.423 --> 00:01:22.252
And then I press Return and I'm there.

16
00:01:22.252 --> 00:01:26.576
You can check that you're there by
typing pwd, print working directory, and

17
00:01:26.576 --> 00:01:27.436
you can see it.

18
00:01:27.436 --> 00:01:32.546
You can make sure that hello, the program
that we're going to run, is in there.

19
00:01:32.546 --> 00:01:36.621
By typing, ls hello*.py,

20
00:01:36.621 --> 00:01:44.446
that'll print all Python
programs that begin in hello.

21
00:01:44.446 --> 00:01:48.447
For those of you that had to create
an environment you need to change

22
00:01:48.447 --> 00:01:50.239
that environment right now.

23
00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:53.479
So you type source activate and

24
00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:58.093
the name of your Python three environment.

25
00:01:58.093 --> 00:02:02.121
Mine is named python36, yours is
probably named something different.

26
00:02:02.121 --> 00:02:06.876
For those of you that didn't have
to create an environment for

27
00:02:06.876 --> 00:02:09.807
Python three you don't do this step.

28
00:02:09.807 --> 00:02:14.529
Now we type python hello.py and
run the program.

29
00:02:14.529 --> 00:02:16.873
And there you see it ran hello, World.

30
00:02:16.873 --> 00:02:20.504
Previously we had typed our
work into the Editor and

31
00:02:20.504 --> 00:02:23.213
we would type changes to our program.

32
00:02:23.213 --> 00:02:27.421
And then we'd run them down
here in the IPython console.

33
00:02:27.421 --> 00:02:28.414
We're going to change that slightly.

34
00:02:28.414 --> 00:02:32.706
We'll still type our work into the Editor,
but

35
00:02:32.706 --> 00:02:37.867
when we run it we're going to
run it over in the terminal.

36
00:02:37.867 --> 00:02:40.125
Let me show you how to do that.

37
00:02:40.125 --> 00:02:42.366
I'm going to make
a change to this program.

38
00:02:42.366 --> 00:02:45.534
Print Goodbye.

39
00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:50.998
I save the change, that's critical.

40
00:02:50.998 --> 00:02:52.576
Then I go over here and

41
00:02:52.576 --> 00:02:57.063
I can press up arrow to call back
that last command and run it.

42
00:02:57.063 --> 00:03:01.574
And you can see that goodbye
is now being printed.

43
00:03:01.574 --> 00:03:05.243
Now for the rest of this course we're
going to write an occasional Python

44
00:03:05.243 --> 00:03:05.792
program.

45
00:03:05.792 --> 00:03:07.770
And we'll have to run it this way.

46
00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.598
I have an older version of
Spyder that provides me

47
00:03:12.598 --> 00:03:16.611
with a terminal right down in this area.

48
00:03:16.611 --> 00:03:20.254
I'm going to use that for
the rest of the course.

49
00:03:20.254 --> 00:03:23.191
You may or may not be able to do that.

50
00:03:23.191 --> 00:03:26.643
I'm using an older version to
record the rest of the video so

51
00:03:26.643 --> 00:03:28.449
that I have that convenience.
