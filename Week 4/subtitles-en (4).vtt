00:00:11.622 --> 00:00:14.407
The first stub that
we're going to flesh in,

2
00:00:14.407 --> 00:00:17.840
write the full function for,
is show phones.

3
00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.061
The reason for that is, if we did delete,

4
00:00:20.061 --> 00:00:22.794
we wouldn't know whether
something was deleted.

5
00:00:22.794 --> 00:00:26.120
If we did new, we wouldn't know
whether something new was done.

6
00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.120
With show phones,

7
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.230
we can see whether these other things
are working when we write them.

8
00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:36.336
Let me run this one just a moment and
show you what it does.

9
00:00:42.606 --> 00:00:44.439
Nothing else really works.

10
00:00:48.084 --> 00:00:49.172
Just show.

11
00:00:53.188 --> 00:01:00.503
Now, the way we're doing this is,
I've gotta have something to show.

12
00:01:00.503 --> 00:01:03.380
So I create a list of phones here.

13
00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.750
It has two phones, Jerry Seinfeld and
his number, Cosmo Kramer and his number.

14
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.600
Each phone is a two-element list
consisting of a name and number.

15
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.624
The name position is 0,
a phone position is 1, and

16
00:01:17.624 --> 00:01:22.562
I'm going to use name_pos and
phone_pos, instead of 0 and 1,

17
00:01:22.562 --> 00:01:27.970
to refer to these, so I don't get
confused as to what I'm looking at.

18
00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.449
There has to be a header for
this name and phone number, and so

19
00:01:33.449 --> 00:01:36.959
I create a header as though
it were another phone.

20
00:01:41.344 --> 00:01:44.140
Now here's the show phones function.

21
00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.849
First of all, I'm going to show phone, the
header, and I'll pass around this blank.

22
00:01:49.849 --> 00:01:53.805
I'll show you what this
blank is about later.

23
00:01:53.805 --> 00:01:57.210
Then I'm going to step through the phones.

24
00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.113
For every phone in phones,
I'm going to show phone, and

25
00:02:00.113 --> 00:02:04.220
I'm going to send this index so
they're numbered, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

26
00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.337
I'll start the index off at one,
after I show a phone,

27
00:02:08.337 --> 00:02:10.940
I'm going to bump the index up by 1.

28
00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.547
And I'm going to pass to show phone,
not only the phone itself, but the index.

29
00:02:17.997 --> 00:02:21.850
And I'm not going to show
the individual phone in this function.

30
00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.430
I'm going to have another
function that will do that.

31
00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.690
And then at the end,
I'm going to skip a line, so

32
00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.910
that there's a little space
after the list of phones.

33
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.170
Here's how we show an individual phone.

34
00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.788
We'll pass the phone, but just remember,
a list with two things in it, the name and

35
00:02:38.788 --> 00:02:40.790
the phone number.

36
00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:41.710
And we send the index.

37
00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.149
We have a string, the index is
going to occupy three spaces, and

38
00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:48.968
it's going to be right justified.

39
00:02:51.772 --> 00:02:56.699
The name is going to occupy 20 spaces,
and it's going to be left justified.

40
00:02:56.699 --> 00:03:00.721
The phone number is going to occupy 16
spaces, and it'll be right justified.

41
00:03:03.847 --> 00:03:07.876
We're going to use that output string,
and we're going to format it, so

42
00:03:07.876 --> 00:03:11.580
that index goes into
the 0th element position.

43
00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.720
Phone name goes into the 1 position, and

44
00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:21.470
phone number goes into the 3rd position.

45
00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.470
And there it is, index,
name, phone number.

46
00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.150
That's all there is to it.

47
00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:32.790
You've got show phones,
which is going to send the header.

48
00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:38.970
It's going to step through the list of
phones and send show phone each phone.

49
00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:44.065
And the show phones are going to
be formatted and printed.

50
00:03:44.065 --> 00:03:51.080
Up here, we did create these things,
and that's to get us by right now.

51
00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.513
Ultimately, we'll set the phones
list to the empty list.
