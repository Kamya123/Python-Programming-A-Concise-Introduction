00:00:12.754 --> 00:00:16.420
Now let's replace some more of
these stubs with real functions.

2
00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.010
Let's start by creating a new phone.

3
00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.350
First, let me show you what
this version will run like.

4
00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.534
They're the ones that we built in,

5
00:00:33.534 --> 00:00:39.148
here's a new one,
enter the data for the new phone.

6
00:00:39.148 --> 00:00:43.681
George Costanza,

7
00:00:43.681 --> 00:00:51.619
(212) 835-1419.

8
00:00:53.591 --> 00:00:55.340
Then we show, and there's George.

9
00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.570
Now we can delete something too.

10
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.500
Well, which one do you want to delete?

11
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.168
We'll delete George.

12
00:01:05.771 --> 00:01:07.580
And now he's gone.

13
00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.528
That's what's new in this version.

14
00:01:10.528 --> 00:01:14.103
First, let's start with
how you create a phone.

15
00:01:14.103 --> 00:01:20.155
When you create a phone, it's going to
print enter the data for a new phone.

16
00:01:21.465 --> 00:01:22.025
There it is.

17
00:01:23.465 --> 00:01:25.985
Then you're going to use
an input to get the new name.

18
00:01:25.985 --> 00:01:30.005
You're going to get the input
to get a new phone number.

19
00:01:30.005 --> 00:01:34.460
Then you're going to build the sub list,
name, and phone number.

20
00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.530
And then you gotta append
it onto the phones list.

21
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.360
And then you skip a line.

22
00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.311
That's all there is to it.

23
00:01:43.489 --> 00:01:45.140
Enter the name, enter the number.

24
00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.360
Build a phone new sub list.

25
00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.180
Append it to the phones list.

26
00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.110
Here with the phone's list here.

27
00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.240
Starts with Jerry Seinfeld and
Cosmo Kramer.

28
00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.680
Now, let's look at delete,
that's a little bit more complex.

29
00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.850
Now down in the main loop.

30
00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.400
When you choose delete, it's going to
ask which item do you want to delete.

31
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.600
And we print, which one it is for
the time being, and

32
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.230
then we'll try to delete that one.

33
00:02:30.626 --> 00:02:32.590
Here's the delete function.

34
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.255
First of all, we check to see
if there's a proper menu choice.

35
00:02:39.255 --> 00:02:43.740
At the time we did this deletion,
there were only three people in there.

36
00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:44.890
I asked for number 17.

37
00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:45.760
He couldn't do it.

38
00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.770
So we're going to check to see if
that's a legitimate menu choice.

39
00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.180
Also, if you typed in a letter or
something like that.

40
00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.104
If we want to filter that out.

41
00:02:59.104 --> 00:03:02.882
So we're going to write a routine
that'll check to see if

42
00:03:02.882 --> 00:03:05.873
that is a proper menu choice and
if it's not,

43
00:03:05.873 --> 00:03:09.590
we're just going to return
without deleting the funnel.

44
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.519
If it is a proper menu choice,
I want to change it to an integer.

45
00:03:17.888 --> 00:03:21.050
And then I'm going to delete one of them.

46
00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:25.150
Now remember, we count these one,
two, three, four,

47
00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.610
five, those are the phone lines.

48
00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.320
But Python counts zero, one, two, three.

49
00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.920
So what we have to do is
reduce that by one and

50
00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.250
then we delete that item
from the phone's list.

51
00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.280
And then we'll print that we deleted it.

52
00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.930
Now let's take a look at this
proper menu choice business.

53
00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:57.350
We pass this switch onto that
proper menu choice function.

54
00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:01.880
Now remember which came from an input
statement, so it's a string.

55
00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.850
Now we're going to have
to convert to a number.

56
00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:07.950
So first of all, we're going to need
to check to see if it's digits in them.

57
00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.580
If it has something in it,

58
00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:15.340
which is not a digit then which
is digit will return false?

59
00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.870
So not is digit would be true and
we would print

60
00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.250
this which needs to be a number
of a phone and return false.

61
00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:30.145
If it returns false to delete phone,

62
00:04:30.145 --> 00:04:37.270
then not false would be true and it
would return without deleting the phone.

63
00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.220
So the first thing that happens is
we check to see if it's a number.

64
00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.910
And if it is a number,
we'll convert it to an integer.

65
00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:48.560
Now there's another problem.

66
00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.040
It could be a negative number.

67
00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:58.195
We could have three phones and
it be the number 217.

68
00:04:58.195 --> 00:04:59.780
We check to see what this negative or

69
00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.540
whether it's a bigger
number than our phones.

70
00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:06.740
If so, we'll print that it needs
to be the number of the phone.

71
00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:15.240
And then we'll return false so that delete
phone will not attempt to delete it.

72
00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:21.800
Now if it passes this test that it's
a number, it converts to a number and

73
00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.480
it's a number that's within the proper
range, then we're going to consider it

74
00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:31.150
an acceptable number to delete and
we'll return true.

75
00:05:33.255 --> 00:05:39.045
So to summarize, delete phones will
be passed which phone to delete.

76
00:05:39.045 --> 00:05:43.624
It will check to see if that's a number,
and it's a number within the proper range,

77
00:05:43.624 --> 00:05:46.204
and if it is,
it'll convert it to an integer and

78
00:05:46.204 --> 00:05:49.578
it'll delete that particular
phone from the phone's list.
