00:00:11.918 --> 00:00:16.280
Now, let's add the capability
of editing a former entry.

2
00:00:19.485 --> 00:00:24.457
If we look down at the menu,
if you choose E for edit,

3
00:00:24.457 --> 00:00:28.432
it'll ask you which one you want to edit.

4
00:00:28.432 --> 00:00:34.647
And then,it'll call
the edit phone routine.

5
00:00:34.647 --> 00:00:37.440
So, we need to look at edit phone routine.

6
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.600
Let me run this thing so
we know where we're going.

7
00:00:43.237 --> 00:00:48.800
Show, we have Kosmo Kramer and
Jerry Seinfeld out there.

8
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.580
So, if I choose Edit, it'll ask which one.

9
00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.350
I'll choose 2.

10
00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.260
So, I'll choose Cosmo Kramer, and

11
00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.670
I can press Enter and
it'll leave the name unchanged.

12
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.806
If I type a new name or phone number,

13
00:01:09.806 --> 00:01:17.160
however, It will replace the old version.

14
00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.600
That's what we're about to add.

15
00:01:29.643 --> 00:01:32.965
Here's edit_phone.

16
00:01:32.965 --> 00:01:35.687
Now, since we're choosing which one,

17
00:01:35.687 --> 00:01:40.640
we've got to make sure that
the user made a proper menu choice.

18
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.660
And we'll use the same proper menu choice

19
00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.260
function as we did with
the delete function.

20
00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.240
When we get back from that,
if it's not a proper menu choice,

21
00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.270
then it'll return without editing anybody.

22
00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.830
If it is a proper menu choice,
we'll convert that to an editor.

23
00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.390
Then, we'll retrieve
that particular phone.

24
00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.718
Now, remember, we're numbering these one,
two, three, four, five, but

25
00:02:08.718 --> 00:02:11.576
Python calls them zero,
one, two, three, four.

26
00:02:11.576 --> 00:02:13.975
So, we have to remove 1.

27
00:02:13.975 --> 00:02:16.340
Then we'll write,
Enter the data for a new phone.

28
00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.703
Press <enter> to leave unchanged.

29
00:02:18.703 --> 00:02:22.660
What we're going to do first
of all is print the name.

30
00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.950
Calling a name position,
calling a 0 is the name.

31
00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.580
Then we'll ask, Enter the phone
name to change or press return.

32
00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.630
We'll do an input and
we'll get a new name.

33
00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.210
Now of course, if you press return,
that new name is just an empty string.

34
00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.760
Otherwise, it's a new name.

35
00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.790
If the new name turns out
to be an empty string,

36
00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.055
we're just going to set
it equal to the old name.

37
00:02:46.055 --> 00:02:49.706
In either case, we've got a new name.

38
00:02:49.706 --> 00:02:51.584
Now, we do the same thing with the phone.

39
00:02:51.584 --> 00:02:55.660
We'll print the phone number,
then we'll ask for a new phone.

40
00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.570
If it's blank, we'll just use
the old phone as the new phone.

41
00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.680
Otherwise, it has a new phone.

42
00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.420
In both cases, we've got a new name and

43
00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.200
a new phone, calling that both
of them could be the old one.

44
00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.010
We'll make a phone out of the new name and
new phone number.

45
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.941
And we'll put it back where we got it.
