00:00:12.457 --> 00:00:17.259
Now, let's replace the stub that says
writing to CSV file with one that

2
00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:20.100
actually writes the CSV file.

3
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.102
First we import the CSV library.

4
00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:30.413
Here is save the phone list.

5
00:00:30.413 --> 00:00:37.785
First we open the CSV file,
myPhones.csv for write.

6
00:00:37.785 --> 00:00:44.060
Then we write every item in
the phones list to that CSV file.

7
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:49.525
We use csv.writer on the file handle f,
and then we write a whole row,

8
00:00:49.525 --> 00:00:53.980
which consists of one item
out of the phones list.

9
00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:54.912
And then we close.

10
00:00:54.912 --> 00:00:57.050
When do we use this?

11
00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.720
Let's go down to the main loop.

12
00:01:01.735 --> 00:01:05.560
save_phone_list is the last thing
we do before we exit the program.

13
00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:08.045
Now let's run it.

14
00:01:14.382 --> 00:01:19.167
We have our usual list of phones,
Jerry Seinfeld and Cosmo Kramer, and

15
00:01:19.167 --> 00:01:20.140
then we quit.

16
00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.510
And when we quit,
we should execute save_phone_list.

17
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.875
So, let's look at myPhones.csv.

18
00:01:30.875 --> 00:01:34.804
And you see that Jerry Seinfeld and
Cosmo Kramer are there.
