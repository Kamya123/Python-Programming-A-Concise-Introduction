00:00:13.207 --> 00:00:17.880
Now we need to write the function that
reads in the CSV file, and we're done.

2
00:00:20.985 --> 00:00:24.110
We're going to import another library OS.

3
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.710
This library deals with
the operating system,

4
00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.690
you'll see how that plays
a role in just a moment.

5
00:00:34.723 --> 00:00:39.850
Scroll down and look at load function,
notice that it's relatively small.

6
00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.870
In fact, most of these functions that
we've been writing are very small.

7
00:00:45.656 --> 00:00:51.299
That's one of the values of breaking
the program up into little functions,

8
00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:55.884
you only have to write small
manageable functions to put it all

9
00:00:55.884 --> 00:00:58.375
together to do a much bigger job.

10
00:01:02.931 --> 00:01:06.880
First, we're going to check to
see if the CSV file is there.

11
00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.645
This method of the OS library,

12
00:01:09.645 --> 00:01:15.420
OS.access will check and look for

13
00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.460
a file called MyPhones.csv in
the current Directory, and

14
00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.250
if it returns os.F_OK then it's there.

15
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.000
If it's there, then we can open it.

16
00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.930
We can read in the rows
using csv.reader and

17
00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.330
we can append each row onto our
phones list, then we close it.

18
00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:49.710
That is, if it's there, if it's not there,
we don't need to load it.

19
00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.195
One of the thing to point out here,
let's go back up to the beginning.

20
00:01:53.195 --> 00:02:00.240
Since we're going to read the phones and
we can eliminate our phone's list

21
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.910
that had two entries in it already and we
can make this phone's list an empty list.

22
00:02:09.486 --> 00:02:11.520
Let's see where it is
it's actually called.

23
00:02:16.088 --> 00:02:21.964
In the main loop, the first thing
we do is load the fund list and

24
00:02:21.964 --> 00:02:26.145
the last thing we do is
save the fund list, so

25
00:02:26.145 --> 00:02:32.890
that we save it when we exit,
we read it in fresh when we enter.

26
00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:38.620
So that it's always either saved
on disc or loaded in the program.

27
00:02:41.591 --> 00:02:44.690
Now let's run our program,
and see the whole thing work.

28
00:02:50.075 --> 00:02:55.465
Show, there's Jerry Seinfeld,
and Cosmo Kramer that we

29
00:02:55.465 --> 00:03:01.683
saved when we tested our
previous version of the program.

30
00:03:01.683 --> 00:03:05.687
You can

31
00:03:05.687 --> 00:03:11.693
add new log.

32
00:03:11.693 --> 00:03:15.693
[SOUND]
And

33
00:03:15.693 --> 00:03:22.693
there is there.

34
00:03:22.693 --> 00:03:24.590
But, you can hit it.

35
00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.740
Let's say that item 2, Cosmo Kramer 2.

36
00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:34.560
We'll press return and keep the name,
we will change the phone.

37
00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:43.910
There's the phone is changed.

38
00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.200
We can show that the phone
is actually changed.

39
00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.710
Cosmo Kramer's phone now is 8789.

40
00:03:56.541 --> 00:04:02.000
We can delete 1, delete Cosmo Kramer.

41
00:04:04.297 --> 00:04:09.090
Sure that he's deleted now,
and then we quit.

42
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.320
Now, let's run the program again.

43
00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:17.130
And when we run the program,

44
00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:22.140
the same file should be right in and
there's what we have,

45
00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:26.720
George Seinfeld and George Costanza,
we don't have Cosmo Kramer anymore.

46
00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:30.946
That's our program.
