00:00:15.606 --> 00:00:17.830
Let's do one more thing.

2
00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.404
Let's run this as a standalone
program from a command line.

3
00:00:21.404 --> 00:00:24.559
First of all, let me create this file.

4
00:00:24.559 --> 00:00:30.422
You want to go back up to the beginning,
The final version.

5
00:00:35.065 --> 00:00:36.503
I'm going to copy it.

6
00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:40.320
Create a new file.

7
00:00:42.634 --> 00:00:43.851
I'm going to paste it.

8
00:00:47.781 --> 00:00:48.877
I'm going to save it.

9
00:00:58.211 --> 00:01:03.845
Now we see the new file, phones.py.

10
00:01:03.845 --> 00:01:09.155
Now let's create command prompt,

11
00:01:09.155 --> 00:01:16.250
and we'll run python phones.py, then show.

12
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.895
There's our data.

13
00:01:18.895 --> 00:01:20.074
I add a new one.

14
00:01:23.402 --> 00:01:28.130
Elaine Denis phone number,

15
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.648
(212) 123-4321.

16
00:01:33.648 --> 00:01:35.336
Show that.

17
00:01:35.336 --> 00:01:36.909
She's there.

18
00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:39.534
We will quit.

19
00:01:39.534 --> 00:01:40.833
Now let's run it again.

20
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.462
So there's Elaine Denis,
we're going to delete her.

21
00:01:51.886 --> 00:01:54.436
She's gone, quit.

22
00:01:57.492 --> 00:01:59.580
And that's our program.

23
00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.570
It will run from the command line.

24
00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:07.442
And we'll update this csv
file that contains our data.
